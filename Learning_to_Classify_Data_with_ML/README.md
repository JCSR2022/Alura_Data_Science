# Customer Investment Adherence Prediction 📈

This repository contains a Machine Learning project focused on **Supervised Classification**. The goal is to predict whether a bank's clients will adhere to a specific investment product based on historical marketing campaign data.

By utilizing predictive modeling, companies can optimize their sales strategies, improve decision-making, and personalize product recommendations.
